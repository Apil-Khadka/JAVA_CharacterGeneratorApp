This folder contains GraphQL schema and operation files that have been temporarily moved
from the main graphql directory to pause GraphQL functionality.

When you're ready to re-enable GraphQL functionality:
1. Restore these files to app/src/main/graphql/
2. Uncomment Apollo GraphQL plugin and dependencies in build.gradle.kts
3. Update the schema to match your backend API

Files were moved on: [current date]
